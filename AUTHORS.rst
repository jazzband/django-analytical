The django-analytical package was written by `Joost Cassee`_, with
contributions from:

`Eric Davis`_
`Paul Oswald`_
and others.

Included Javascript code snippets for integration of the analytics
services were written by the respective service providers.

The application was inspired by and uses ideas from Analytical_, Joshua
Krall's all-purpose analytics front-end for Rails.

The work on Crazy Egg was made possible by `Bateau Knowledge`_.
