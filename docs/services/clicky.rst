Clicky -- traffic analysis
==========================

Clicky_ is an online web analytics tool.  It is similar to Google
Analytics in that it provides statistics on who is visiting your website
and what they are doing.  Clicky provides its data in real time and is
designed to be very easy to use.

.. clicky-installation:

Installation
============

To start using the Clicky integration, you must have installed the
django-analytical package and have added the ``analytical`` application
to :const:`INSTALLED_APPS` in your project :file:`settings.py` file.
See :doc:`../install` for details.

Next you need to add the Clicky template tag to your templates. This
step is only needed if you are not using the generic
:ttag:`analytical.*` tags.  If you are, skip to
:ref:`clicky-configuration`.

The Clicky tracking code is inserted into templates using a template
tag.  Load the :mod:`clicky` template tag library and insert the
:ttag:`clicky` tag.  Because every page that you want to track must
have the tag, it is useful to add it to your base template.  Insert
the tag at the bottom of the HTML body::

    {% load clicky %}
    ...
    {% clicky %}
    </body>
    </html>


.. _clicky-configuration:

Configuration
=============

Before you can use the Clicky integration, you must first set your
website Site ID.  You can also customize the data that Clicky tracks.


.. _clicky-site-id:

Setting the Site ID
-------------------

Every website you track with Clicky gets its own Site ID, and the
:ttag:`clicky` tag will include it in the rendered JavaScript code.
You can find the Site ID in the *Info* tab of the website *Preferences*
page, in your Clicky account.  Set :const:`CLICKY_SITE_ID` in the
project :file:`settings.py` file::

    CLICKY_SITE_ID = 'XXXXXXXX'

If you do not set a Site ID, the tracking code will not be rendered.


.. _clicky-internal-ips:

Internal IP addresses
---------------------

Usually you do not want to track clicks from your development or
internal IP addresses.  By default, if the tags detect that the client
comes from any address in the :const:`CLICKY_INTERNAL_IPS` setting,
the tracking code is commented out.  It takes the value of
:const:`ANALYTICAL_INTERNAL_IPS` by default (which in turn is
:const:`INTERNAL_IPS` by default).  See :ref:`identifying-visitors` for
important information about detecting the visitor IP address.


.. _clicky-custom-data:

Custom data
-----------

As described in the Clicky `customized tracking`_ documentation page,
the data that is tracked by Clicky can be customized by setting the
:data:`clicky_custom` JavaScript variable before loading the tracking
code.  Using template context variables, you can let the :ttag:`clicky`
tag pass custom data to Clicky automatically.  You can set the context
variables in your view when you render a template containing the
tracking code::

    context = RequestContext({'clicky_title': 'A better page title'})
    return some_template.render(context)

It is annoying to do this for every view, so you may want to set custom
properties in a context processor that you add to the
:data:`TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` list in :file:`settings.py`::

    def clicky_global_properties(request):
        return {'clicky_timeout': 10}

Just remember that if you set the same context variable in the
:class:`~django.template.context.RequestContext` constructor and in a
context processor, the latter clobbers the former.

Here is a table with the most important variables.  All variables listed
on the `customized tracking`_ documentation page can be set by replacing
``clicky_custom.`` with ``clicky_``.

==================  ===============  ===================================
Context variable    Clicky property  Description
==================  ===============  ===================================

                                     ``revenue`` keys.
------------------  ---------------  -----------------------------------
``clicky_split``    split_           Split testing page version.  A
                                     dictionary containing ``name``,
                                     ``version`` and optionally ``goal``
                                     keys.

``clicky_href``     href_            The URL as tracked by Clicky.

``clicky_title``    title_           The page title as tracked by
                                     Clicky.  Default is the HTML title.
